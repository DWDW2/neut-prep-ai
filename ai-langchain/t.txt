  "question": "Which one of the following identifies the principle underlying the above argument?",
  "statement": "Buttons that are on the right-hand side of clothes are easier to fasten and unfasten for a right-handed person than for a left-handed person. Buttons are on the right-hand side of clothes for men, but on the left side for women. This arose because buttons used to be very expensive and were only worn by women who were rich enough to have a servant who helped them to dress. But almost everyone buttons their own clothes now, so manufacturers of women’s clothes should now place the buttons on the right-hand side.",

  "question": "Which one of the following best expresses the main conclusion of the argument?",
  "statement": "Doctors who are paid on a fee-for-service basis have a financial incentive to overtreat patients. This is because they are paid for each service they provide.  For example, a doctor might order a series of expensive tests for a patient with a minor illness, even if these tests are not really necessary. Therefore, patients should be careful about choosing doctors who are paid on a fee-for-service basis.",

    "D": "Doctors should not be paid on a fee-for-service basis.",
    "E": "There are alternative payment schemes for doctors that are more beneficial to patients."
